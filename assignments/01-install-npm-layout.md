# Tailwind: intro

---

## Task

1. Start a project and install Tailwind using `npm`.

2. Add `.gitignore` with the list of paths, changes of which should not be tracked.

3. Explore the [Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) and use it for the reference when working on this assignment. For this assignment you might need to look at utiliti classes for **responsiveness**, **flexbox basics**, **colors**, **spacing** and **sizing**.

4. Create responsive layout using Tailwind classes according to the screenshots attached for responsive behaviour. Feel free to deviate from the color pallete on the screenshot and explore other colors.

5. Work only with HTML and Tailwind predefind classes, no custom CSS in needed.

Enjoy!
